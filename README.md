## How to Play
- To start the game, simply click on any of the images on the board. This will reveal the image behind it.
- Click on a second image to reveal its content as well. If the two images are a match, they will remain face-up. If they are not a match, they will flip back over.
- Continue flipping over two cards at a time until you match all the pairs on the board.
- The game is over once all pairs have been matched.
